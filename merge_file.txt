A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. Git can merge the changes automatically only if the commits are on different lines or branches.Types of Git Merge Conflicts 
There are two points when a merge can enter a conflicted state:

1. Starting the Merge Process 
If there are changes in the working directory’s stage area for the current project, merging won’t start. 

In this case, conflicts happen due to pending changes that need to be stabilized using different Git commands.

2. During the Merge Process
The failure during the merge process indicates that there is a conflict between the local branch and the branch being merged.

In this case, Git resolves as much as possible, but there are things that have to be resolved manually in the conflicted files.

We will now go over resolving merge conflicts in Git.

How to Resolve Merge Conflicts in Git?
There are a few steps that could reduce the steps needed to resolve merge conflicts in Git.

The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes
After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content
The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command
Git will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge
Let us now look into the Git commands that may play a significant role in resolving conflicts.

Git Commands to Resolve Conflicts
1. git log --merge 
The git log --merge command helps to produce the list of commits that are causing the conflict

2. git diff 
The git diff command helps to identify the differences between the states repositories or files

3. git checkout 
The git checkout command is used to undo the changes made to the file, or for changing branches

4. git reset --mixed 
The git reset --mixed command is used to undo changes to the working directory and staging area

5. git merge --abort
The git merge --abort command helps in exiting the merge process and returning back to the state before the merging began

6. git reset
The git reset command is used at the time of merge conflict to reset the conflicted files to their original state
